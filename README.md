# Android Background Screen Recorder
This app records the device screen using a foreground service. Recording stops when the display is off and will start again when the display is turned on again. Killing the app will not stop recording, only the toggle on/off button.
Video files are saved locally in the movie directory in  MP4 format. Timestamp, screen orientation are included in the file name.
